Hey everyone, hope you all are doing well.

I use Kali Linux in Vmware and it works fine.
Now I have a problem while booting.

I was updating my system with the sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade command. But in between my system got turned off automatically due to electricity issue. 
I opened the system again when the electricity was back and then it was showing something as shown in the image below:

How do I fix this because it gets stuck on this point.

Please help me.
